My journey in technology has taken me across continents - from India to Singapore, and now to Melbourne, Australia. Each transition has enriched my perspective on leadership and innovation in technology. As a Principal Engineer, I've learned that success in tech isn't just about code - it's about values that guide our decisions and actions.

Here are the core values that drive me:

* **Open-mindedness**: I believe in embracing diverse perspectives and innovative solutions. The best ideas can come from unexpected places.
* **Continuous Growth**: Learning never stops in tech. I'm committed to both personal growth and fostering development in my teams.
* **Data-Driven Leadership**: I make decisions based on metrics and measurable outcomes, ensuring our technical choices are grounded in reality.
* **Empathy**: Technical excellence and human connection are equally important. Great software is built by people who understand each other.
* **Environmental Ethics**: Technology should serve not just people, but our planet. I advocate for sustainable practices in our technical decisions.
* **Equality**: Innovation thrives in inclusive environments. I build teams where every voice matters and diversity is celebrated.
