I'm Mugunth Kumar (MK), an engineering leader with nearly 20 years of experience in software architecture, design, and development. I live in Melbourne, Australia, and bring a global perspective to technology leadership.

I'm currently building [The Neural Library](https://theneurallibrary.com), a comprehensive web and mobile application designed for book enthusiasts to manage their TBR (To Be Read) lists.
