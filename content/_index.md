I'm Mugunth Kumar (MK), an engineering leader with nearly 20 years of experience in software architecture, design, and development. Originally from India, I moved to Singapore for my higher education and a decade later, relocated to Melbourne, Australia, restarting my career, and moved up to a Principal Engineer. I bring a global perspective to technology leadership, having built and led successful teams across Asia-Pacific.
