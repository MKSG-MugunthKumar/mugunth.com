## Open Source Contributions

I'm passionate about contributing to open source software and sharing knowledge with the developer community. Here are some of my notable contributions:

### Generative AI Projects

#### ask-claude

I built `ask-claude`. It is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/MKSG-MugunthKumar/ask-claude)


It is a shell function that leverages Generative AI Model, Claude by Anthropic to generate contextually accurate terminal commands for macOS and Linux systems. Simply describe what you want to do, and get the correct command for your specific OS and version!

> Because everyone deserves a helping hand in the terminal, only if they know how to exit vim ðŸ˜‰ - MK

### Full Stack Development
I'm currently developing The Neural Library, a comprehensive web and mobile application designed for book enthusiasts to manage their reading lists effectively. This full-stack application helps readers organize their To Be Read (TBR) lists, track reading progress, and discover new books.

The tech stack includes:
- Backend: Python & Django
- Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Mobile: Swift and Kotlin (Native Stack on both platforms)

The project emphasizes clean architecture, modern UI/UX principles, and robust API design. Select components of this project will be open-sourced in the coming months to benefit the developer community.

### Mobile Development

Over the years, I've contributed to various mobile development projects and libraries. My focus has been on improving developer experience and creating robust solutions for common challenges in mobile app development.
