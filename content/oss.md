## Open Source Contributions

I'm passionate about contributing to open source software and sharing knowledge with the developer community. Here are some of my notable contributions:

### Generative AI Projects

#### ask-claude

I built `ask-claude`. It is available on Github [here](https://github.com/MKSG-MugunthKumar/ask-claude)


It is a shell function that leverages Generative AI Model, Claude by Anthropic to generate contextually accurate terminal commands for macOS and Linux systems. Simply describe what you want to do, and get the correct command for your specific OS and version!

> Because everyone deserves a helping hand in the terminal, only if they know how to exit vim ðŸ˜‰ - MK


### Mobile Development

Over the years, I've contributed to various mobile development projects and libraries. My focus has been on improving developer experience and creating robust solutions for common challenges in mobile app development.
