## About Me

I'm Mugunth Kumar (MK), an engineering leader with nearly 20 years of experience in software architecture, design, and development. Originally from India, I moved to Singapore for my higher education and a decade later, relocated to Melbourne, Australia, restarting my career, and moved up to a Principal Engineer. I'm always confident of starting again from scratch. I bring a global perspective to technology leadership, having built and led successful teams across Asia-Pacific. For the last decade, I've been managing software engineering teams, alternating between a people management role and a hands-on role to keep myself up to date on technology while building, nurturing, and mentoring high-performance cross-functional teams. I've authored programming books and spoken at international conferences, demonstrating my expertise and leadership in the field.
